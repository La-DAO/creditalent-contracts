## Credit Talent Smart Contracts

CreditTalent is a set of smart contracts that facilitate loans between users. In the CreditTalent smart contract system the lenders also function as underwriters and
make active decision on which users to lend based on different types of scoring such as the [Builder Score](https://docs.talentprotocol.com/docs/talent-passport/builder-score) from Talent Protocol.
